`qairoe-app-router`
It&#39;s a simple routing system that changes the viewport depending on the route given per page.
It uses PRPL pattern by lazy loading page elements.

It is usually put inside your shell or as `main-content` part of `app-layout` or with our
`qairoe-app-layout`

```html
<qairoe-app-router parent-tag-name="custom-app-shell">
  <page-element-one route="/page"></page-element-one>
  <page-element-two route="/page/:id"></page-element-two>
  <page-element-three route="/page/:id/edit" auth="[[someBooleanValue]]"></page-element-three>
  <page-not-authorized not-authorized></page-not-authorized>
  <page-not-found not-found></page-not-found>
</qairoe-app-router>
```

Inside the `qairoe-app-layout`

```html
<qairoe-app-layout>
  <project-header main-header></project-header>
  <project-drawer main-drawer></project-drawer>
  <qairoe-app-router main-content parent-tag-name="custom-app-shell">
    ...
  </qairoe-app-router>
</qairoe-app-layout>
```

### Using Route patterns

Route patterns are put in the attribute route per page element, which defines when
they will show if and when the pattern is matched with the url.

```html
<page-element-one route="/page"></page-element-one>
```

Currently it follows a simple pattern like this:

```
/page - for matching it with a url /page only
/page/:id - for matching it with a url /page/somevalue where somevalue is put in the variable id
/page/* - for matching all urls with a prefix /page
```

### Setting Params and QueryParams

If the route has a `:`, it will use the name after the `:` as a variable and put it in the `params`
attribute.

All query-params (anything after the `?` character in the url) becomes part of the `queryParams` attribute.

When a view is put in display, the previous view's exitView method, if it exists, will be called with a parameter
data that includes params and queryParams as its properties. The previous view's exitView method can do some cleaning
or animation or data gathering before the previous view exits. The exitView should return a Promise so as to be chained
before loading the next view.

When the next view is to be put in display, it will lazy-load the element first if it doesn't exist in the system,
and then calls the enterView method of the next view, if it exists. The enterView method accepts a paramater object data
which has params and queryParams properties. The router also sets the attributes params and queryParams of the
view's element as well. The next view's enterView method can do some initialization, animation
or data gathering before the next view enters fully. 

### Limitations

We are trying to increase the number of patterns to match so that it will be more robust in the future. If you found
some bugs or suggestions please don't hesitate to write an issue or use a PR.
